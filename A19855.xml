            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

was then riſen about thoſe <hi>Hugonotes,</hi> they would needes knowe of
their goſtlye fathers and holy inquintinge Fryers, what thoſe <hi>French
Hugonotes</hi> were: vnto whom that deuoute and Pop-holy generation
(not vnlike themſelues) made this wholeſome and catholike anſwere:
<hi>That they were not men</hi> forſooth, <hi>but vglye and monſtrous ſhapes of men,
headed like Dragons, faced like Dogges: eared like Swine, ſnoured like Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents,

fell ſtraight to a kinde of hiſſing &amp; clapping their hands, with moſt bit<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter
out cries and hatfull exclamations againſt them, with fie on them
wretches, fie on them wretches. Now even thus good reader (and no
better then thus) fareth it with me at this inſtant. The name &amp; ſound
of <hi>Darrell,</hi> of his impriſonment, and the cauſe therof, hath in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
poſſeſſed &amp; overſpread the whole land. why, what is he ſaith one?
what is the matter ſaith another? Anſwere is made preſently and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dilye
by our two Engliſh Inquiſiters. <hi>Samuell Harſnet</hi> and his maſter,
togeather with ſuch others, whom they with theire crooked conuey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances
haue be witched, that <hi>Darrell</hi> is forſooth <hi>a cogger, a couſener,
a Iugler, an Exorciſt, a counterfeite, a deuill-flinger, a deuill-driuer, a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducer,
a deceiuer, an Impoſtor,</hi> and I know not what: that <hi>of an impious
ſimplicitie he holdeth it lawfull to lye, cogge and faine, ſo it be to a good end,
(as his fauorits tearme it,) to the glory of God, in which regard he hath tak<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>en
vpon him to be deeplye ſeene in the myſterie of deuils, and hath playd his
publike prize in this iuglinge ſcience, caſting out more deuils by prayer and
faſting after a good dinner perhaps, then euer any? of the Apoſtlee did at ſo
full a ſeaſon.</hi> And this in effect not onely the ſtreetes and Tavernes
haue ronge off, but (as I haue bene informed) the very benches and
<pb facs="tcp:9801:4"/>
Seates of Iuſtice haue ſounded with the noyſe of this <hi>Darrell,</hi> the <hi>deuil
driuer,</hi> and of the <hi>counterfeite</hi> trickes that he ſhould teach. VVherein
notwithſtandinge I thanke God, when they haue thundered out the
vttermoſt they can againſt me, I may truly ſay (and that with the teſti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>monie
of mine owne hart and conſcience) that I am iuſt ſo guiltie of
the thinge they charge me with, as the fore-recited <hi>French Hugonotes</hi>
were of all that rablement wherewith they were ſo beſmeared and de
pictured by that Italian munckiſh fraternitie. For if it be true that the
had heades like <hi>dragous,</hi> faces like <hi>dogges,</hi> eares like <hi>ſwine,</hi> ſnoutes like
<hi>ſerpentes,</hi> and that they would eate vp their <hi>mothers, &amp;c.</hi> Then is it alſo
true I confeſſe, that <hi>Darrell</hi> is ſuch a mounſtrous vile fellow as is heere
layd forth and deſcribed. But alas good reader this is no new thinge:
looke backe to ages paſt and thou ſhalt find it to be an old inueterate
ouerworne practiſe of ſathan, newly furbiſhed and ſet abroach againe
by his inſtrumentes, to paint out the profeſſors of the goſpell in the
moſt ougly deformed ſhape they can deuiſe: (as we ſee by our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
Chriſt and his Apoſtles and ſo conſequently by his miniſters ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially:)
not that they be ſuch indeede as they are deſpitfully featured
out, but to this end, to make them more odiouſly enuied and maliti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
hated of the world, which is the ſpeciall marke the enimy ſhoot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
at.</p>
            <p>Now the principall thinge that is charged vpon me, (and which I
haue all this while denied, and ſtill denye) is, <hi>teachinge to counterfeite.</hi>
But what is this, that <hi>Darrell</hi> ſhould thus <hi>teach to counterfeite?</hi> why no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinge
els forſooth, but a <hi>reall entrance and poſſeſſion of the deuill of and
into the bodies of men, to be diſpoſſeſſed and remooued thence by faſting and
prayer, and all to grace and make good the hipocriticall faſting and exerciſe
of the puritans, which otherwiſe (without ſome ſuch fetches and deuiſes) wou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ld
prooue ſtarke naught.</hi> This then we ſee is the ſinne, if it be true. And
ſuerly allow it to be true and to be ſuch indeede as they haue layde it
forth to be with all his circumſtances, I my ſelfe will ſubſcribe &amp; ioyne
with them in the condemnation of it to the bottome of hell, and the
ſinner to the very depth of the graue, as wherin (if it be rightly exami<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed
and weighed,) is cloſlye ſhut vp and included not onely the diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
of God and diſgrace of his workes, but a foule and deteſtable a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe
of Godes church and a mocking of Gods people, with a ſcorne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
and ſhameles contempt both of magiſtracy and miniſterie. And
can not the wiſdome and maieſtie of the ſtate of <hi>England</hi> finde out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due
puniſhment and correction for ſo wretched and greiuous an enor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mitie
as this? no queſtion but it can, may, and ought, if the partie were
once orderlye and by law convicted. But as it was not the manner of
<hi>Romanes</hi> in auntient time for fauor to deliuer any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to death before
<pb facs="tcp:9801:4"/>
the partie accuſed had his accuſers before him, &amp; leaue to defend him
ſelfe: ſo is it not the manner of the Honorable Courtes of Iuſtice in
<hi>England,</hi> to proceed to ſentence before conviction, or to puniſhment
before apparant proofe. And this is it that hath and doth make me
more confident in defenſe of myne owne innocencie, and the equitie
of my cauſe, even the reuerent opinion and eſtimation that I haue of
the ordinarie courtes of Iuſtice in this land, before whom whenſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
I ſhalbe called, I know it is not a hundred of ſuch lying and libel<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ling
diſcourſes as this of <hi>Samuell Harſnetes,</hi> that ſhall any way ſwaye
them, either to ſentence or cenſure the meaneſt of her Maieſties ſub<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>iectes
without euidence and proofe.</p>
            <p>But my fault they will needes haue to be double: one <hi>an error in my
Iudgment,</hi> the other <hi>a plaine knacke of knauery</hi> (for I can call it no bet<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter)
<hi>in my practiſe.</hi> For the firſt my ſimple Iudgment (as I haue alrea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dy
both by word &amp; writting made knowne) is this: <hi>That as the bodies
of men may really be poſſeſſed of Sathan in this age as well as in former
times: ſo the ordinarie way and meanes of their diſpoſſeſſion and deliuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
is prayer, or prayer and faſtinge.</hi> This is (in effect) all that I hold,
and contend for. wherin I willinglye referre and ſubmitt my ſelfe to
the godly learned of our Church. I challeng no power to worke mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles,
nor guift aboue others to caſt out deuils. I haue not vſed any
adiuration: all which are fathered vpon me, but I condemned the
ſame in others. And now before the Lord and men I doe vtterly &amp;
from my ſoule renounce them, as heeretofore I haue often done with
my tongue &amp; pen: what groſſe and dangerous <hi>error</hi> then doe I main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine?
For the other that is <hi>my knacke or packe of knauery in teachinge
to counterfeite, and fayning a diſpoſſeſſion by prayer, when their were no
ſuch things performed:</hi> I cannot be perſwaded (for all this impudent &amp;
ſhameles diſcourſe of <hi>S Harſnetes,</hi> ſo bedecked and adorned with my
<hi>L. of Londons flowers</hi>) that they themſelues in their conſciences doe be
leeue this knacke of knauerie againſt me in that ſort as they haue ſett
it downe.<note place="margin">1</note> The reaſons that induce me ſo to thinke be theſe.</p>
            <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">as men proph<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly call them.</note> becauſe they would not ſuffer <hi>Somers</hi> or rather the deuill in
him to doe his trickes, though they were ſundrie times deſired pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liklye
and priuatly that he might doe them for the better endinge of
the controuerſie, and that he offered to doe the ſame.</p>
            <p>Secondly, their manner of proceeding againſt me contrarie to
the ordinarie courſe of iuſtice and equitie:<note place="margin">2</note> yea ſuch as heathens and
infidels would bluſh and be aſhamed to vſe: as appeareth by the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars

any ſuch extraordinarie and vnlawfull proceedings, If they were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded

would cleare himſelfe of <hi>teaching to counterfeite,</hi> if he ſhould be admitt<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed
to a proceeding according to the lawes of the Realme in ſuch caſes
prouided?</p>
            <p>Thirdly, their very writtinge againſt me in this caſe in that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
as they haue done,<note place="margin">3</note> is ſufficient in the iudgment of the wiſe to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cry
and diſcouer the guiltines of their conſciences this way. For what
a teſt were it to puniſh treaſon or rebellion by <hi>Booke-writting?</hi> I will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inglye
confeſſe the ſinne they charge me with (if it be true) to be as
bad as rebellion, and to deſerue more then the pillorie, yea a ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full

proue the thinges publiſhed againſt me in that printed Libell of <hi>S.
Harſnetes,</hi> they ſhall neede no Iurie to paſſe vpon me, neither will I
craue any fauour but iuſtice with ſeueritie. Seeinge then the puniſhe
not nor neuer went about to puniſh this ſuppoſed offence according
to the weight and deſert thereof: nay haue bene ſo farr from that, as
within 14. dayes after the publiſhinge of the booke made againſt me,
they offered me libertie vpon condition I would promiſe not to pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ach

the poſſeſſion and diſpoſſeſſinge of the perſons controverted nor
deale any more in the diſpoſſeſſinge of any: and yet haue publiklye
made it knowne for ſo haynous and notorious a crime, what doth
this argue but that inwardly in theire owne ſoules, they doe not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leiue
their owne lible?</p>
            <p>Fourthly, their often and ordinarie bringinge in the teſtimonie
of <hi>Somers</hi> againſt me in theire ſaide booke, (able to make a horſe to
ſpue) whenſoeuer they are at a ſtand and can by no meanes writhe

            <p>If any thinke that the charge of <hi>counterfeiting,</hi> and <hi>of my teachinge
to counterfeite</hi> (the ſumme of the booke anſweared by me,) is ſo lying,
ſlaunderous, abhorring to common ſence, palpable falſe, and vnpoſſi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ble
to be true, that it was altogether vnworthy the anſwearinge and
convincing, or at leaſt of ſo large an anſweare and conviction as heere
followeth: ſuch may remember that the Apoſtles being charged with

&amp; conuinced that vile ſlaunder. In like ſort did our Sauiour Chriſt
being charged more vily to be a coniurer, and <hi>to caſt out deuils through

<pb facs="tcp:9801:7"/>
even to teach vs what to doe whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any ſuch thing falleth out. Now
the larger I haue bene for theſe two reaſons. Firſt, I thought it fitt to
anſweare to all that is contained in the <hi>Diſcouery,</hi> which ſeemeth to
make more or ſelfe againſt the cauſe or my ſelfe: leaſt paſſing by ſome
of this kind, it might be thought I therfore did it and purpoſly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
I were not able to anſwere. Againe, I co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidered that many haue
already giuen an eare to <hi>counterfeitinge,</hi> and verily beleiue our <hi>Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makes</hi>
to be <hi>counterfeits:</hi> for their ſakes therfore, &amp; that I might draw
theſe preiudicate: perſons from their error to the imbracinge of the
truth, it was requiſite to anſwere all that in the face made for counter<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>feitinge,
which could not be performed in fewe wordes. Secondly, I
knewe the credit of the aduerſarie was great, my owne little, beinge
a baſe &amp; contemptible perſon in the eyes of the world. That my ſelfe
then and that which I contend for might be beleiued, even of this
dotinge and blind generation, It was neceſſarie I ſhould not onely
cracke or diminiſh the credite of the a duerſarie, even with his beſt
frendes, which might haue bene done in afew wordes: but take all cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
from him, by detectinge all his filthines: for in makinge his name
to rotte and ſtinke, and the counterfeit cauſe he hath in hand, their is
hope that men will giue ſome eare vnto me, and that I ſtriue for, be I
neuer ſo meane. Now this would be beſt performed in the larger pur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſuite
and ſtirringe deepely in the falſhods, lyes, and abſurdities of the

to be in the ample ripping vp of this foule <hi>Diſcouery,</hi> to the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tection</hi>

the 7. as well as the other 4. and that 3. of the 4. were helped by the

then I haue done the like to the 7. in <hi>Lancaſhire</hi> alſo: but conſidering
I am not accuſed thereof, and if I were I truſt they would cleare me

Samuell, ſaying that ſhe did bewitch him: and thus remayning in this extr<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>aordinary

that he ſay that this man counterfeyted too, and learned ſo to do of

                  <p>VVith this letter came another to the effect aforeſaide from <hi>M.
Aldridge</hi> the boyes paſtor: when peruſing this ſubſcription, I founde

that they in their letter, and their meſſenger more at large related vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to

I aduiſed them to vſe the meanes of faſting and prayer for his dely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerance

was procured and ſent to me, vpon the receipt whereof I went. For
thus truly I thought, that foraſmuch as ſundrye of the inhabitants of

the magiſtrate who were intereſſed in the boy, called and deſired my
poore aduice and aſſiſtance, it was my part and duty to goe, and to
yealde them my beſt aſſiſtance, contrary to that I had purpoſed and
written before, as being called of god to that worke: and hereabout
I conſulted alſo with two godly &amp; learned men then in <hi>Aſhby:</hi> who

then knoweth he the moſt of theſe thinges as well as I: yea almoſte
no man better: for beſides that he hath heard (vndoubtedly) of theſe
ſeuerall letters (<hi>M. Ireton</hi> his excepted) many times: he may remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
that he being a commiſſioner, among other intergatoryes, they
had one concerning the occaſion of my comminge to <hi>Not.</hi> and that
<hi>Miſtres Gray</hi> and M. <hi>William Langford</hi> among others being depoſed

whereas without this, he is to enter into and poſſeſſe the ſaid perſon,

this, page 43. Thus in a word we ſee his collection and boaſtinge to
be meerely in vayne. Yet for our better vnderſtanding and further
anſwer, we muſt remember: that two kindes of expulſion of ſathan
are heere ſpoken of one extraordinary, wherein the miraculous faith
is required, verſe 20. and an other by an ordinary meanes, viz. praier
or prayer and faſting, verſe 21. and here howſoeuer the iuſtifyinge
faith is to be wiſhed, and is beſt: yet the faith temporall, or hiſtorical
may ſuffice, for the expelling of ſathan after this manner, or by the
ordinary meanes, which ſtandeth not ſomuch in the <hi>ſaith</hi> of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
therein vſed, as in the mercye of god obteyned, man vſinge the
meanes which to that end he hath ordeyned. And as this faith may
ſuffice, ſo it ſhould ſeeme that it hath or ſhall: for we reade that in
the day of the lorde, ſome workers of iniquity ſhall ſay for themſelus

                     <note place="margin">math. 7. 22.</note> why ſhould we vnderſtand
this of <hi>Iudas</hi> only and ſuch as he, who by a word caſt out diuells, ſeing
that manner of eiection continued ſo ſmall a time in the church: And
not as well of the ſonnes of <hi>Sceua?</hi> (and ſuch as they) who it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
caſt out diuells by the ordinary meanes, where-with they had
mixed ſome adiurations, (where-vpon they were called <hi>Exorciſtes</hi>)
added thereto in that and former time when all things almoſte were
corrupted, and as it is very likely vpon ſome imitation of the proph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets,
who had (no doubt) caſt out diuels by adiuring or commaund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the ſpirits to goe out in the name of the lorde: as the papiſts doe

that they had not receaued any ſuch power ouer vncleane ſpi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rits,
and therefore ſhould haue refrayned from commuanding or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuring
them. True it is that they were far from caſting the euill ſpirit
out of the man mentioned <hi>Acts</hi> 19. the reaſon I thinke was becauſe
they entred upon that where-vnto they were not at all called of god:
for not contented with that manner of eiection they had formerlye
vſed, becauſe it ſhewed no ſuch authority ouer diuells, as that perf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

theſe 3: ſignes were vſually heard and ſeene in the egreſſe of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
yet it may be not alwayes, but ſometimes two or percaſe one did
ſuffice to ſignify the ſame, and yet are not the other therefore in vai<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e
becauſe the more ſignes the more we are confirmed in the diſpoſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of one: for why may not this as well be true of the ſignes of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſion
as of poſſeſſion? where all the ſignes are not required. but
ſome of many may ſuffice, as hath bene ſhewed before yea what &amp;

And yet this is but one effect or operation of ſathan: &amp; ſo but
one ſigne of poſſeſſion. And why one ſigne may not ſuffice to ſignify
the ſpirits going out of a man, as well as this being in the body of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
I for my part doe not ſee neither doe I think that the <hi>Diſc.</hi> can ſhew
any reaſon. And although be it one, or more, there is ſinguler vſe of
the ſigne or ſignes, to ſignifye the egreſſſe, as I haue ſhewed before,
treating thereof: Yet are the ſignes of diſpoſſeſſion of no ſuch abſolut
neceſſity, as the ſignes of poſſeſſion are, as might eaſilye be ſhewed.
And therefore I will not deny but that one may be diſpoſſeſſed, and
none of theſe ſignes appeare, which is more: the health and eaſe of
the party from all former vexation by the diuell, declaring his deliue
rance from the diuell, as it is in naturall diſeaſes: yet I think it falleth
out thus very ſeldome if euer, for the reaſons formerly giuen by me.

mouth, when he was at <hi>Garlands</hi> houſe, as is plaine by the depoſitions
concerning the ſame, which was almoſt 20. weekes after the foaming
wee ſpeake off. Now although <hi>blacke lead</hi> may peradventure haue
ſuch an odd myſticall qualitie as is pretended, yet it could not (ſure)
cauſe him to foame, ſo long and ſo many weekes before he had it. For
theiris no body that depoſeh to any <hi>blacke lead:</hi> then and if he had

that he might <hi>the better foame,</hi> But how doth the <hi>Diſcouerer</hi> proue

<hi>he doth not beleiue ſo.</hi> Then by the depoſition of <hi>Ieſſe. Bee</hi> a ſadler, who
ſaith: <hi>that whoſoeuer affirmeth ſo, doth lye in ſo affirming.</hi> There reaſon
is, becauſe of the <hi>godly ſpeaches he vſed mentioned in the dialogues.</hi> Then
and in the third and laſt place the <hi>Diſc.</hi> himſelfe telleth vs, that for
the ſame reaſon he thinketh that it can not be that the ſaide <hi>dialogues</hi>
came from the deuill: his wordes be theſe: <hi>If any man will take the

wordes almoſt could be deliuered more vnlikely to proceede from

Heere is great adoe and much prattle about <hi>packing, diſſimulation,</hi>
and I knowe not what, and of the feare forſooth that was on my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe

to proue any thing,<note place="margin">the 1. circum<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtauce</note> muſt needes probablie conclude this ſaid <hi>packing.</hi>
The firſt circumſtance and argument of his is this. <hi>Since the preteuded
diſpoſſeſſion of Darling, Darrell hath cheriſhed, entertained, and lodged
Darling:</hi> it is probable theirfore that <hi>Darrell</hi> taught <hi>Darling</hi> to coun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>terfeite
apoſſeſſion: and that at ſuch time or times ther was ſome <hi>pack<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing</hi>

<hi>antecedent</hi> or former parte of his reaſon the <hi>Diſco.</hi> pretendeth to
proue both by my owne depoſition and <hi>Darlinges,</hi> but he doth not
proue it fully: for in it he ſpeaketh of my <hi>cheriſhing of Darling,</hi> as if
he had bene my darling in deede, or as if I had bene ſome foſter fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
vnto him, but proueth no ſuch thinge, but onely the bare lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge
of him one night onely: and truely I doe not remember that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
he did eate one crumme of bread in my houſe in his life. But ad<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mitte
he had ſupped with me as well as lodged with me, and ſtayed
with me a longer time, not that night onely, but diuers nightes, what
of all that? admittinge the <hi>antecedent</hi> to be true (as it is falſe) yet how
doth the conſequent and it hange together by M. <hi>Harſnetes</hi> logike?
many haue both eaten and lodged with me, whom I neuer packed
nor conſulted with about <hi>diſſemblinge a poſſeſſion.</hi> The ſecond cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance
is, <hi>Darrell willed Darling to be conſtant and ſticke to the
truth, and not ſuffer himſelfe to be drawne to affirme that he had diſſemled</hi>
I wold be loth to blot paper or ſtand long in anſwering and refuting

eyes and to behold the vanitie of it, and withall the ſhifting pacherie
of this <hi>diſcouerer</hi> who pretendeth forſooth and would faine haue the

that I vſed any ſuch ſpeaches to him in my houſe at <hi>Aſhbte</hi> the night
I lodged him there, or ſpake any words vnto him to that effect. This

the credite of him and <hi>Somrrs</hi> and of the reſt of the ſuppoſed coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeites:

As to her brother, ſo to her, a little thinge in appearance was done to

be their againe 3. Vpon and duringe this ſwelling ſhe felt ſomthinge
(as it were quicke) ſtirr within her, whervpon ſhe thought eſpecially
at the firſt, that ſhe was with child, and now &amp; then alſo through her
great ſimplicitie ſhe ſo hoped a great while after: &amp; yet alwayes from
the begininge ſhe ſaid, that that ſtirring was nothing like to that ſhe

about 13. or 14. weekes, ſhe fell a traueling, ſo as midwife af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
midwife and neighbour weomen were called in and ſent for, wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>in
(as I was credibly informed) it went thus with her. At the begining
of her trauile, her belly was about the bignes aforeſaid and ſoft: the
next day very bigg, but ſoft: not long after very bigg, and hard as if
ſhe had bene indeede with child, and at the poynte of deliuerance:
ſometimes alſo ſhe was very gaunt, hauinge her belly leſſe then a wo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mans
ordinarily is. Moreover, a ſtirringe or movinge was ſometimes
ſeene and felt in very ſtrange and admirable manner, as if theire had
bene ſome quicke thinge cauſinge it, but ſo as no ſubſtance could be
felt: and this was in ſundrie partes of her body, as about her ſtomake,
aboue her breſtes, and in her arme or ſhoulder. And this rare accide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
together with this ſtrange alteration in her belly, from little to great,
and from great to little, from ſoft to harde, &amp; from harde to ſoft, was
duringe the time of her trauell, which was for 2. or 3. dayes, as I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member.
She had the paynes of a woman in trauill: and in danger of
death, as many women in trauell: in ſo much as they which were with
her deſpayringe of her life, cauſed the bell to be toled for her. In a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>word,
ſhe was in althinges like to a woman in trauell, diſtering onely
heerein from others, in that they bring forth ſomethinge, either liu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge
&amp; reaſonable creature, or ſome vntimely birth: but ſhe nothinge
at all, neither then nor after: trauell after trauell, and nothing but

was knowne or heard of to come from any woman, but where a
child was either brought or their to be brought into the world: and
yet loe no child. Beſides theſe things which ſhe had in common with

and a ſhame for men to ſay ſo: ſhe had this in ſpeciall and proper to
